# The Booleans' properties

The type of booleans is interesting in homotopy type theory because it
is the simplest type where its automorphisms in `Type`{.Agda} are
non-trivial. In particular, there are two: negation, and the identity.

But first, true isn't false.

```agda
true≠false : true ≡ false → ⊥
true≠false p = subst P p tt where
  P : Bool → Type
  P false = ⊥
  P true = ⊤
```

It's worth noting how to prove two things are **not** equal. We write a
predicate that distinguishes them by mapping one to `⊤`{.Agda}, and one
to `⊥`{.Agda}. Then we can substitute under P along the claimed equality
to get an element of `⊥`{.Agda} - a contradiction.

## Discreteness

It's quite easy to tell whether two booleans are equal:

```agda
Discrete-Bool : Discrete Bool
Discrete-Bool false false = yes refl
Discrete-Bool false true = no (λ p → true≠false (sym p))
Discrete-Bool true false = no true≠false
Discrete-Bool true true = yes refl

isSet-Bool : isSet Bool
isSet-Bool = Discrete→isSet Discrete-Bool
```

Furthermore, if we know we're not looking at true, then we must be
looking at false, and vice-versa:

```agda
x≠true→x≡false : (x : Bool) → (x ≡ true → ⊥) → x ≡ false
x≠true→x≡false false p = refl
x≠true→x≡false true p = absurd (p refl)

x≠false→x≡true : (x : Bool) → (x ≡ false → ⊥) → x ≡ true
x≠false→x≡true false p = absurd (p refl)
x≠false→x≡true true p = refl
```

## The "not" equivalence

The construction of `not`{.Agda} as an equivalence factors through
showing that `not` is an isomorphism. In particular, `not`{.Agda} is its
own inverse, so we just need a proof that it's involutive:

```agda
not-involutive : (x : Bool) → not (not x) ≡ x
not-involutive false i = false
not-involutive true i = true
```

With this, we can get a proof that it's an equivalence:

```agda
isEquiv-not : isEquiv not
isEquiv-not = isIso→isEquiv (iso not not-involutive not-involutive)
```

## Aut(Bool)

We characterise the type `Bool ≡ Bool`. There are exactly two paths, and
we can decide which path we're looking at by seeing how it acts on the
element `true`{.Agda}.

First, two small lemmas: we can tell whether we're looking at the
identity equivalence or the "not" equivalence by seeing how it acts on
the constructors.

```agda
private
  idLemma : (p : Bool ≃ Bool)
          → p .fst true ≡ true
          → p .fst false ≡ false
          → p ≡ (_ , idEquiv)
  idLemma p p1 p2 = Σ-Path (funext lemma) (isProp-isEquiv _ _ _) where
    lemma : (x : Bool) → _
    lemma false = p2
    lemma true = p1
```

If it quacks like the identity equivalence, then it must be. Otherwise
we're looking at the `not`{.Agda} equivalence.

```agda
  notLemma : (p : Bool ≃ Bool)
           → p .fst true ≡ false
           → p .fst false ≡ true
           → p ≡ (not , isEquiv-not)
  notLemma p p1 p2 = Σ-Path (funext lemma) (isProp-isEquiv _ _ _) where
    lemma : (x : Bool) → _
    lemma false = p2
    lemma true = p1
```

With these two lemmas, we can proceed to classify the automorphisms of
`Bool`{.Agda}. For this, we'll need another lemma: If a function `Bool →
Bool` _doesn't_ map `f x ≡ x`, then it maps `f x ≡ not x`.

```agda
AutBool≡2 : (Bool ≡ Bool) ≡ Lift _ Bool
AutBool≡2 = Iso→path the-iso where
  lemma : (f : Bool → Bool) {x : Bool} → (f x ≡ x → ⊥) → f x ≡ not x
  lemma f {false} x with Discrete-Bool (f false) true
  lemma f {false} x | yes p = p
  lemma f {false} x | no ¬p = absurd (¬p (x≠false→x≡true _ x))

  lemma f {true} x with Discrete-Bool (f true) false
  lemma f {true} x | yes p = p
  lemma f {true} x | no ¬p = absurd (¬p (x≠true→x≡false _ x))
```

This lemma is slightly annoying to prove, but it's not too complicated.
It's essentially two case splits: first on the boolean, and second on
whether we're looking at `f x ≡ not x`. If we are, then it's fine (those
are the `yes p = p` cases) - otherwise that contradicts what we've been told.

```agda
  the-iso : Iso (Bool ≡ Bool) (Lift _ Bool)

  fst the-iso path with Discrete-Bool (transport path true) true
  ... | yes path = lift false
  ... | no ¬path = lift true
```

Now we classify the isomorphism by looking at what it does to
`true`{.Agda}. We arbitrarily map `refl`{.Agda} to `false`{.Agda} and
`not`{.Agda} to `true`{.Agda}.

```agda
  g (snd the-iso) (lift false) = refl
  g (snd the-iso) (lift true)  = ua (not , isEquiv-not)
```

The inverse is determined by the same rule, just backwards. That's why
it's an inverse! Everything computes in a way that lines up to this
function being a `right-inverse`{.Agda} on the nose.

```agda
  right-inverse (snd the-iso) (lift false) = refl
  right-inverse (snd the-iso) (lift true) = refl
```

The left inverse is a lot more complicated to prove. We examine how the
path acts on both `true` and `false`. There are four cases:

```agda
  left-inverse (snd the-iso) path with Discrete-Bool (transport path true) true
                                     | Discrete-Bool (transport path false) false
  ... | yes true→true | yes false→false =
    refl                  ≡⟨ sym (univalence-Iso .snd .left-inverse _) ⟩
    ua (pathToEquiv refl) ≡⟨ ap ua pathToEquiv-refl ⟩
    ua (_ , idEquiv)      ≡⟨ ap ua (sym (idLemma _ true→true false→false)) ⟩
    ua (pathToEquiv path) ≡⟨ univalence-Iso .snd .left-inverse _ ⟩
    path                  ∎
```

In the case where the path quacks like reflexivity, we use the
univalence axiom to show that we must be looking at the reflexivity
path. For this, we use `idLemma` to show that `pathToEquiv path` must be
the identity equivalence.

```agda
  ... | yes true→true | no false→true' =
    let
      false→true = lemma (transport path) false→true'
      fibres = isContr→isProp (pathToEquiv path .snd .isEqv true)
                              (true , true→true) (false , false→true)
    in absurd (true≠false (ap fst fibres))
```

The second case is when both booleans map to `true`{.Agda}. This is a
contradiction - transport along a path is an equivalence, and
equivalences have contractible fibres; Since we have two fibres over
`true`{.Agda}, that means we must have `true ≡ false`.

```agda
  ... | no true→false' | yes false→false =
    let
      true→false = lemma (transport path) true→false'
      fibres = isContr→isProp (pathToEquiv path .snd .isEqv false)
                              (true , true→false) (false , false→false)
    in absurd (true≠false (ap fst fibres))
```

The other case is analogous.

```agda
  ... | no x  | no x₁  =
    ua (not , isEquiv-not) ≡⟨ ap ua (sym (notLemma _ (lemma (transport path) x)
                                                     (lemma (transport path) x₁)))
                            ⟩
    ua (pathToEquiv path)  ≡⟨ univalence-Iso .snd .left-inverse _ ⟩
    path                   ∎
```

The last case is when the path quacks like `ua (not, _)` - in that case,
we use the `notLemma`{.Agda} to show it _must_ be `ua (not, _)`, and the
univalence axiom finishes the job.
