# h-Levels

The "homotopy level" (h-level for short) of a type is a measure of how
[truncated] it is, where the numbering is offset by 2. Specifically, a
(-2)-truncated type is a type of h-level 0. In another sense, h-level
measures how "homotopically interesting" a given type is:

* The contractible types are maximally uninteresting because there is
only one.

* The only interesting information about a proposition is whether it is
inhabited.

* The interesting information about a set is the collection of its inhabitants.

* The interesting information about a groupoid includes, in addition to
its inhabitants, the way those are related by paths. As an extreme
example, the delooping groupoid of a group -- for instance, [the circle] --
has uninteresting points (there's only one), but interesting _loops_.

[the circle]: agda://1Lab.HIT.S1

For convenience, we refer to the collection of types of h-level $n$ as
_homotopy $(n-2)$-types_. For instance: "The sets are the homotopy
0-types". The use of the $-2$ offset is so the naming here matches that
of the HoTT book.

The h-levels are defined by induction, where the base case are the
_contractible types_.

```agda
record is-contr {ℓ} (A : Type ℓ) : Type ℓ where
  constructor contr
  field
    centre : A
    paths : (x : A) → centre ≡ x

open is-contr public
```

A contractible type is one for which the unique map `X → ⊤` is an
equivalence. Thus, it has "one element". This doesn't mean that we can't
have "multiple", distinctly named, inhabitants of the type; It means any
inhabitants of the type must be connected by a path, and this path must
be picked uniformly.

```agda
module _ where
  data [0,1] : Type where
    ii0 : [0,1]
    ii1 : [0,1]
    seg : ii0 ≡ ii1
```

An example of a contractible type that is not _directly_ defined as
another name for `⊤` is the unit interval, defined as a higher inductive
type.

```agda
  interval-contractible : is-contr [0,1]
  interval-contractible .centre = ii0
  interval-contractible .paths ii0 i = ii0
  interval-contractible .paths ii1 i = seg i
  interval-contractible .paths (seg i) j = seg (i ∧ j)
```

A type is (n+1)-truncated if its path types are all n-truncated.
However, if we directly take this as the definition, the types we end up
with are very inconvenient! That's why we introduce this immediate step:
An **h-proposition**, or **proposition** for short, is a type where any
two elements are connected by a path.

```agda
is-prop : ∀ {ℓ} → Type ℓ → Type _
is-prop A = (x y : A) → x ≡ y
```

With this, we can define the `is-hlevel`{.Agda} predicate. For h-levels
greater than zero, this definition results in much simpler types!

```agda
is-hlevel : ∀ {ℓ} → Type ℓ → Nat → Type _
is-hlevel A 0 = is-contr A
is-hlevel A 1 = is-prop A
is-hlevel A (suc n) = (x y : A) → is-hlevel (Path A x y) n
```

Since types of h-level 2 are very common, they get a special name:
**h-sets**, or just **sets** for short. This is justified because we can
think of classical sets as being equipped with an equality _proposition_
$x = y$ - having propositional paths is exactly the definition of
`is-set`{.Agda}.  The universe of all types that are sets, is,
correspondingly, called **Set**.

```agda
is-set : ∀ {ℓ} → Type ℓ → Type ℓ
is-set A = is-hlevel A 2
```

Similarly, the types of h-level 3 are called **groupoids**.

```agda
is-groupoid : ∀ {ℓ} → Type ℓ → Type ℓ
is-groupoid A = is-hlevel A 3
```

# Preservation of h-levels

If a type is of h-level $n$, then it's automatically of h-level $k+n$,
for any $k$. We first prove a couple of common cases that deserve their
own names:

```agda
is-contr→is-prop : is-contr A → is-prop A
is-contr→is-prop C x y i =
  hcomp (λ j → λ { (i = i0) → C .paths x j
                 ; (i = i1) → C .paths y j
                 } )
        (C .centre)
```

<!--
```agda
SingletonP : ∀ {ℓ} (A : I → Type ℓ) (a : A i0) → Type _
SingletonP A a = Σ[ x ∈ A i1 ] PathP A a x

SinglP-is-contr : ∀ {ℓ} (A : I → Type ℓ) (a : A i0) → is-contr (SingletonP A a)
SinglP-is-contr A a .centre = _ , transport-filler (λ i → A i) a
SinglP-is-contr A a .paths (x , p) i =
  _ , λ j → fill A (λ j → λ {(i = i0) → transport-filler (λ i → A i) a j; (i = i1) → p j}) (inS a) j

SinglP-is-prop : ∀ {ℓ} {A : I → Type ℓ} {a : A i0} → is-prop (SingletonP A a)
SinglP-is-prop = is-contr→is-prop (SinglP-is-contr _ _)
```
-->

This enables another useful characterisation of being a proposition,
which is that the propositions are precisely the types which are
contractible when they are inhabited:

```agda
contractible-if-inhabited : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} → (A → is-contr A) → is-prop A
contractible-if-inhabited cont x y = is-contr→is-prop (cont x) x y
```

The proof that any contractible type is a proposition is not too
complicated. We can get a line connecting any two elements as the lid of
the square below:

~~~{.quiver}
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  x && y \\
  \\
  {C \id{.centre}} && {C .\id{centre}}
  \arrow[dashed, from=1-1, to=1-3]
  \arrow["{C \id{.paths}\ x\ j}", from=3-1, to=1-1]
  \arrow["{C \id{.paths}\ y\ j}"', from=3-3, to=1-3]
  \arrow["{C \id{.centre}}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
~~~

This is equivalently the composition of `sym (C .paths x) ∙ C.paths y` -
a path $x \to y$ which factors through the `centre`{.Agda}. The direct
cubical description is, however, slightly more efficient.

```agda
is-prop→is-set : is-prop A → is-set A
is-prop→is-set h x y p q i j =
  hcomp (λ k → λ { (i = i0) → h x (p j) k
                 ; (i = i1) → h x (q j) k
                 ; (j = i0) → h x x k
                 ; (j = i1) → h x y k
                 })
        x
```

The proof that any proposition is a set is slightly more complicated.
Since the desired homotopy `p ≡ q` is a square, we need to describe a
_cube_ where the missing face is the square we need. I have
painstakingly illustrated it here:

To set your perspective: You are looking at a cube that has a
transparent front face. The front face has four `x` corners, and four `λ
i → x` edges. Each double arrow pointing from the front face to the back
face is one of the sides of the composition. They're labelled with the
terms in the `hcomp`{.Agda} for `is-prop→is-set`{.Agda}: For example, the
square you get when fixing `i = i0` is on top of the diagram. Since we
have an open box, it has a lid --- which, in this case, is the back face
--- which expresses the identification we wanted: `p ≡ q`.

With these two base cases, we can prove the general case by recursion:

```agda
is-hlevel-suc : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} (n : Nat) → is-hlevel A n → is-hlevel A (suc n)
is-hlevel-suc 0 x = is-contr→is-prop x
is-hlevel-suc 1 x = is-prop→is-set x
is-hlevel-suc (suc (suc n)) h x y = is-hlevel-suc (suc n) (h x y)
```

By another inductive argument, we can prove that any offset works:

```agda
is-hlevel-+ : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} (n k : Nat) → is-hlevel A n → is-hlevel A (k + n)
is-hlevel-+ n zero x    = x
is-hlevel-+ n (suc k) x = is-hlevel-suc _ (is-hlevel-+ n k x)
```

A very convenient specialisation of the argument above is that if $A$ is
a proposition, then it has any non-zero h-level:

```agda
is-prop→is-hlevel-suc
  : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} {n : Nat} → is-prop A → is-hlevel A (suc n)
is-prop→is-hlevel-suc {n = zero} aprop = aprop
is-prop→is-hlevel-suc {n = suc n} aprop =
  is-hlevel-suc (suc n) (is-prop→is-hlevel-suc aprop)
```

Furthermore, by the upwards closure of h-levels, we have that if $A$ is
an n-type, then paths in $A$ are also $n$-types. This is because, by
definition, the paths in a $n$-type are "$(n-1)$-types", which
`is-hlevel-suc`{.Agda} extends into $n$-types.

```agda
Path-is-hlevel : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} (n : Nat) → is-hlevel A n → {x y : A}
               → is-hlevel (x ≡ y) n
Path-is-hlevel zero ahl =
  contr (is-contr→is-prop ahl _ _)
        λ x → is-prop→is-set (is-contr→is-prop ahl) _ _ _ x
Path-is-hlevel (suc n) ahl = is-hlevel-suc (suc n) ahl _ _

                 → is-hlevel (PathP A x y) n
Path-p-is-hlevel {A = A} n ahl {x} {y} =
  subst (λ e → is-hlevel e n) (sym (PathP≡Path A x y)) (Path-is-hlevel n ahl)
```

# is-hlevel is a proposition

Perhaps surprisingly, "being of h-level n" is a proposition, for any n!
To get an intuitive feel for why this might be true before we go prove
it, I'd like to suggest an alternative interpretation of the proposition
`is-hlevel A n`: The type `A` admits _unique_ fillers for any `n`-cube.

A contractible type is one that has a unique point: It has a unique
filler for the 0-cube, which is a point. A proposition is a type
that admits unique fillers for 1-cubes, which are lines: given any
endpoint, there is a line that connects them. A set is a type that
admits unique fillers for 2-cubes, or squares, and so on.

Since these fillers are _unique_, if a type has them, it has them in at
most one way!

```agda
is-contr-is-prop : is-prop (is-contr A)
is-contr-is-prop {A = A} (contr c₁ h₁) (contr c₂ h₂) i =
  record { centre = h₁ c₂ i
         ; paths = λ x j → hcomp (λ k → λ { (i = i0) → h₁ (h₁ x j) k
                                          ; (i = i1) → h₁ (h₂ x j) k
                                          ; (j = i0) → h₁ (h₁ c₂ i) k
                                          ; (j = i1) → h₁ x k })
                                 c₁
         }
```

First, we prove that being contractible is a proposition. Next, we prove
that being a proposition is a proposition. This follows from
`is-prop→is-set`{.Agda}, since what we want to prove is that `h₁` and `h₂`
always give homotopic paths.

```agda
is-prop-is-prop : is-prop (is-prop A)
is-prop-is-prop {A = A} h₁ h₂ i x y = is-prop→is-set h₁ x y (h₁ x y) (h₂ x y) i
```

Now we can prove the general case by the same inductive argument we used
to prove h-levels can be raised:

```agda
is-hlevel-is-prop : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Type ℓ} (n : Nat) → is-prop (is-hlevel A n)
is-hlevel-is-prop 0 = is-contr-is-prop
is-hlevel-is-prop 1 = is-prop-is-prop
is-hlevel-is-prop (suc (suc n)) x y i a b =
  is-hlevel-is-prop (suc n) (x a b) (y a b) i
```

# Dependent h-Levels

In cubical type theory, it's natural to consider a notion of _dependent_
h-level for a _family_ of types, where, rather than having (e.g.)
`Path`{.Agda}s for any two elements, we have `PathP`{.Agda}s. Since
dependent contractibility doesn't make a lot of sense, this definition
is offset by one to start at the propositions.

```agda
is-hlevel-dep : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {A : Type ℓ} → (A → Type ℓ') → Nat → Type _

is-hlevel-dep B zero =
  ∀ {x y} (α : B x) (β : B y) (p : x ≡ y)
  → PathP (λ i → B (p i)) α β

is-hlevel-dep B (suc n) =
  ∀ {a0 a1} (b0 : B a0) (b1 : B a1)
  → is-hlevel-dep {A = a0 ≡ a1} (λ p → PathP (λ i → B (p i)) b0 b1) n
```

It's sufficient for a type family to be of an h-level everywhere for the
whole family to be the same h-level.

```agda
is-prop→pathp : ∀ {B : I → Type ℓ} → ((i : I) → is-prop (B i))
              → (b0 : B i0) (b1 : B i1)
              → PathP (λ i → B i) b0 b1
is-prop→pathp {B = B} hB b0 b1 = to-pathp (hB _ _ _)
```

The base case is turning a proof that a type is a proposition uniformly
over the interval to a filler for any PathP.

```agda
is-hlevel→is-hlevel-dep
  : ∀ {ℓ ℓ'} {A : Type ℓ} {B : A → Type ℓ'}
  → (n : Nat) → ((x : A) → is-hlevel (B x) (suc n))
  → is-hlevel-dep B n
is-hlevel→is-hlevel-dep zero hl α β p = is-prop→pathp (λ i → hl (p i)) α β
is-hlevel→is-hlevel-dep {A = A} {B = B} (suc n) hl {a0} {a1} b0 b1 =
  is-hlevel→is-hlevel-dep n (λ p → helper a1 p b1)
  where
    helper : (a1 : A) (p : a0 ≡ a1) (b1 : B a1)
           → is-hlevel (PathP (λ i → B (p i)) b0 b1) (suc n)
    helper a1 p b1 =
      J (λ a1 p → ∀ b1 → is-hlevel (PathP (λ i → B (p i)) b0 b1) (suc n))
        (λ _ → hl _ _ _) p b1
